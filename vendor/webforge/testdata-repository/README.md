a repository for global testdata
============================
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pscheit/webforge-testdata-repository.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pscheit/webforge-testdata-repository)

Writing testdata can really be a tricky task. This project tries to gather testdata from everywhere for a lot of common tasks in developer life. It should not be language dependent, so that testdata can be contributed from everyone who writes tests.
Globalized and shared testdata has a lot advantages for everyone:

  - often used testdata is more consistent and has fewer data errors
  - more edge cases are covered
  - writing tests will be faster
  - writing the test and implementation gets the focus
  - you have lesser excuses to not write tests
  - tests and data will be decoupled cleanly

Testdata writing can be fun! Imagine a world of testdata, where test people live 
(did you heard of [Max Mustermann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_placeholder_names_by_language) these days?)
Testdata cars are driving, credit cards have numbers...

I really like the "hands on code thing" and started working out a small example for NestedSets.

roadmap
============================
  - how to gather good test data
  - data representation
  - search for contributors and people with interest
  - write more motivation texts
